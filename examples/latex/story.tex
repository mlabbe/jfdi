Once upon a time there was a grumpy programmer who disliked dependencies.  He grew tired of pulling in other people's code and learning their APIs, just to discover they barely worked half of the time.  He set out to fix this by writing really tiny standalone programs that, incidentally, ran blisteringly fast on modern computers.

He was still a grumpy programmer, but he was a satisfied, grumpy programmer.
